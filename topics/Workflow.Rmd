# `dplyr`




# Flavors of Apply

#### `apply()`

"Returns a vector or array or list of values obtained by applying a function to margins of an array or matrix."

You specify the `MARGIN`: "a vector giving the subscripts which the function will be applied over. E.g., for a matrix 1 indicates rows, 2 indicates columns, c(1, 2) indicates rows and columns. Where X has named dimnames, it can be a character vector selecting dimension names.""

#### `lapply()`

- `lapply` returns a list of the same length as X, each element of which is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X."
    - "`sapply` is a user-friendly version and wrapper of `lapply` by default returning a vector, matrix or, if simplify = "array", an array if appropriate, by applying `simplify2array()`."
        - "`vapply` is similar to `sapply`, but has a pre-specified type of return value, so it can be safer (and sometimes faster) to use."
        - "`replicate` is a wrapper for the common use of `sapply` for repeated evaluation of an expression (which will usually involve random number generation)."
        - "`rapply` is a recursive version of `lapply`."

#### `mapply()`

- "`mapply` is a multivariate version of `sapply`. `mapply` applies FUN to the first elements of each ... argument, the second elements, the third elements, and so on."  Also see `outer`.


#### `tapply()`

- "Apply a function to each cell of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty) group of values given by a unique combination of the levels of certain factors."  ???
    - `sweep` and `aggregate` are convenience.
    
    - `by` is an object-oriented wrapper for `tapply` applied to data frames.
