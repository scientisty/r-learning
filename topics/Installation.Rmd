On OSX need `dupes/tcl-tk` for Brew to build R with tcl-tk support. OSX supposedly has an older version but it's not found when R compiles with Brew. No brew options are needed, but believe tck/tk support will silently not build if libs not available.

Think about using `--with-openblas` flag. Not sure what happends if brew openblas is not installed at the time?
