# [Subsetting](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html)


`subset()`
`split()`
`merge()`


Note: these may apply more broadly than data frames.

`cut()`
`split()`

`aggregate()`



# Factors

Factors can be unordered or [ordered](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Changing_the_order_of_levels_of_a_factor/).  Ordered factors impose an inequality among levels.

- `factor()` - create factor

- `ordered()` - create ordered factor

- `relevel()`

- `reorder()`

I believe that factors are by definition characters, so if you end up with numeric data as a factor then to convert to simple numeric values you do `as.numeric(as.character(myfactor))` or else you will end up with sequential integers reflecting the factor levels arbitrarily.
