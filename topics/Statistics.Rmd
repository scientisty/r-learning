This will be a heavy document about doing statistics in R.  Since the two are almost synonymous, it will also be a chance to illustrate general statistical concepts.

##Model Formulae




---

---

# `stats` package



## Distributions


- `dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE)`
- `pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)` 
- `qnorm(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)`
- `rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)`


## Covariance

- `var(x, y = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, use)`
- `cov(x, y = NULL, use = "everything", method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))`
- `cor(x, y = NULL, use = "everything", method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))`
- `cov2cor(V)`

- `symnum()` ?


---

## Model Fitting


- `lm()` - linear model - `glm()` - generalized linear model

- `nls()` - nonlinear least squares


`base::summary()` give you info about the model you fitted.  Applied to data
frames it summarizes each column.


## t-Test

Berkeley has nice notes on [using t-tests in
R](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/r-t-tests).

`t.test()`


## Regressions


`poly()`/`polym()`


---

## Clustering


`dist()` - distance matrix

`hclust()` - has print(), plot(), identify functions


##Principal Component Analysis


- `princomp()`


---

---


# `MASS` package

## Discriminant Analysis

- `lda()` - `qda()`
